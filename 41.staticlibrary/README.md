# Static Linking

now we know that in other language lika java , python adding libary is very easy but in c++ its not so easy , so lets make this clear.

- hate the idea of package manager
- Just straight away use direct library
- just clone and compile and run

# Likning again Binary

- here we will be using opengl library
- there are two directory include and lib directory
- inlcude directory has a bunch of header files that we can use the functions
- lib directory has thode functions defined
- Now there usually two phases for this i.e dyncamic library and static library
- static linking means its gets clipped into our binary i.e exe but in dynamic libary gets clipped in runtime.
- usually try to use static linking as this is sometime faster.
- So here we are gonna see both of them static and dynamic one.
